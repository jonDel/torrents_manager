Creating your distribution file

Create your distribution file like so:

$ cd path/to/torrentsManager
$ python setup.py sdist

Running that last command will create a MANIFEST file in your project directory, and also a dist and build directory. Inside that dist directory is the distribution that you’ll be uploading to the PyPI. In our case, the distribution file will be named torrentsManager-0.1.0.tar.gz. Feel free to poke around in the dist directory to look at your distribution.

Uploading your distribution file

Before uploading you first need to create an account at http://pypi.python.org/pypi . Once that’s complete, register your distribution at the PyPI like so:

$ cd path/to/torrentsManager
$ python setup.py register

Use your existing login (choice #1). It will prompt you to save the login info for future use (to which I agree). Then upload:

$ python setup.py sdist upload

This builds the distribution one last time and then uploads it.

Thanks for your contribution!
Updating your distribution

Down the road, after you’ve made updates to your distribution and wish to make a new release:

    increment the version number in your setup.py file,
    update your CHANGES.txt file,
    if necessary, update the “Contributors” and “Thanks also to” sections of your README.txt file.
    run python setup.py sdist upload again.
